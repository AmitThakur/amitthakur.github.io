title: Things I learnt
---

* I can achive my goals if:
	* I have patience. Sometimes it takes very long, but patience always pays off.
	* I have focus. Greater attention and highly focused target–I get things done easily.
	* I have strong will power. I must never quit.
	* I believe in myself. It's okay to have some fears.
	* I am honest to myself. Taking decision under pressure and with dishonesty always ruins the hard-work and time.

* Success is nothing like one-shot game, it keeps evolving over time. It’s a journey, not a destination.
* It's okay to mess up while trying out new things, but the idea is to stick with the process, and keep learning.
* With experience, I become efficient and accurate. But experience comes with a lot of practice and facing challenges, and it does take some time.
