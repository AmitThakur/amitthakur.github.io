title: Migrating to Github pages
---

The migration of this blog to Github pages was one of the pending items in my 2017's to-do list. 

The Github pages does not match the level of customization of the legendary Wordpress, but helps a lot on focusing on writing the actual blog content than the time consuming website maintenance work.

I'm not a prolific blogger. So the older blog posts count is small enough to be moved manually.

The migration will be completed in completed in a couple of days. All the older links will be redirected to newer links.

Thanks!
