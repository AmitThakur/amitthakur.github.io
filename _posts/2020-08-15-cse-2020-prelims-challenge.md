Hi! A very happy independence day to my fellow Indian citizens.

Today I would like to let you know about a personal challenge that I want to pursue for next 40 days. 
I know many would laugh at me but I just want to try it for fun and to see what is my knowledge gathering capacity in the trade which is different from my active profession.

So without further ado, I tell you here that I'm preparing for Indian Civil Services Examination 2020 Prelims in just next 40 days.
Yes, that's the very competitive CSE Prelims exam conducted by UPSC, Govt of India. This year, 2020, the prelims exam is scheduled on October 4th.

Since high school years around 2006 I have stayed away from humanities and arts studies. The CSE paper has a big part of its syllabus covered by general studies and current affairs topics. My knowledge level in those topics is abysmal. I have spent a greater amount of time learning maths, physics, and software engineering. So If I were to appear in the CSE paper today I would
score awful for sure.

I'm a software engineer by profession and I'm quite happy with my current job. Do not expect me to leave my current job to pursue CSE preparation full time, like many candidates do. I'll do it with whatever time I can manage along with my 10 hour job plus managing cooking and home (I stay alone BTW).

This year I applied for the exam in February month without any serious goal - it costs you just INR 100. Covid-19 also happened this year because of which prelims exam has been postponed from May to October. My current employment started few months ago so I was very busy in my current job learing stuff for current project till now... and I still am. So yes, it will be a big challenge where I would be competing against more than a million candidates, many of whom would have finished their preparation and would be revising their notes by this time to secure few hundred civil services positions.

I believe that pursuing big challenge helps me keep pushing my abilities furher and make me wiser. So here is my plan for this challenge - I would be posting my prelims test series performance every week from now. This journaling would also help me to focus and actively pursue this goal.

Cheers!
