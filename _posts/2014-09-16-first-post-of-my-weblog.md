> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit. -Aristotle

With this motivational quote, I start my own weblog. This blog is an aggregation of my thoughts and ideas coming to my mind. I always wanted a platform to have an open conversation with people around the world. 

Iâ€™ll be talking about science, engineering, technology, mathematics, art, and some of my personal experiences. If you are interested to read all posts on my blog then you are welcome to do so, if not then I will categorize the posts based on topics.

You can make any type of comment here: constructive, destructive, criticizing or encouraging. What I want is a greater level of thought interaction with you.

Thank you for visiting.

Have a nice day!
