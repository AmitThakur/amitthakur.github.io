title: I have started learning AI
---

Yes, I have started learning AI, very slowly, and bit-by-bit.

I did a [research project]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/anprs/) in computer-vision during my final year (2013) of college.
It was primarily a combination of [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) and object recognition problem.
I solved the object recognition part using heuristic approach but had no clue how to solve the former.
I read some research paper on OCR and tried implementing them using OpenCV APIs I but didn't have any clue what algorithms were used and how they were implemented.

At the time, deep-neural-network usage were documented on the web, and some of the today's popular tools were not there then (TensorFlow) or were just evolving (scikit-learn).

I finished the OCR implementation using Google's Tesseract. I had EE background and knew basic programming in C++ and worked on GUI using Qt but I didn't know the better parts of linear algebra, statistics, and neural network to understand advanced ML.

Few months later I got a job offer from Infosys for a Systems Engineering role. I didn't work on the computer vision projects or any kind of research projects for next 4 years. During these years I learnt enterprise/e-commerce/cloud software application development.

One weekend evening in early summers of this year, I was browsing through my college projects directory, and thought of going back and solving my OCR problem with my own
implementation. The ML/AI ecosystem had evolved much in these years. I thought of catching up with the growing AI world. I immediately googled
some good MOOC courses on AI. Udacity's nanodegree on Foundations of Artificial Intelligence looked promising. I immediately signed-up to get
the basic understanding of evolving system. I finished the nanodegree before deadline and  [graduated](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/KAHLZDWD) in June, 2018. It introduced me to Python language, data structure and algorithms, linear algebra, statistics, basics of data science, and basics of ML and AI.

I wanted to learn more. It thrills me to create something cool on my own. So I googled some high quality books, blogs, and open source projects available on AI/ML. This time I wanted to learn all of the nanodegree's topics in-depth. So I made my mind to learn these slowly and bit-by-bit. I have started reading and doing hands-on exercises.

Let's see how this journey goes.

Cheers!
