Hi!

Today I wasn't feeling well in the morning. Skipped the morning jogging and yet enjoyed wonderful view from my
apartment's balcony.

The weather in Bengaluru today looked clear with scattered clouds in the morning, The temerature is very pleasant
around 25Â°C these days.

I cleaned the house today after 3 days, and cooked Okra and Chapathi for meal.

I started refining the idea of Electronic Lab Notebook, the hackathon project I took in an annual hackathon
[LEAP-2018](https://thermofisher.spigit.com/leap2018q1/).

That was it for today. Tomorrow going to learn some new stuff.

Cheers and have a great day!
