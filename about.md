I'm Amit Thakur.

I'm a software engineer by profession and currently work at Thermo Fisher Scientific - Cloud applications team. In my free time, I work on  my own project, [FeedPlayr](http://feedplayr.com).

Previously, I worked for Infosys for a two and half years at Bengaluru, India as a Systems Engineer.

I spent my childhood at Jaipur, India. I completed my school and bachelor education in the same city.

I never had stellar academic record, but I enjoyed studying mathematics and physics during high school. 
I loved making electronic projects. I got motivation for that from my elder cousin brother.

My mother bought me my first computer at the age of 20, during 1st year of my engineering college.
I wrote my first program in C++ on Windows 7 OS. I fell in love with it.
I tried a lot of things with computers, like, developing websites, desktop application applications 
for my college projects, and learning scientific computing using Matlab, OpenCV, and C++ language. [Here is the detailed list of tools and technologies I use]({{site.baseurl}}/about/tools-technologies-i-use) in my daily work.

I have affinity for mathematics, physics, and computer science. I see beauty in some patterns in objects, 
and feel aesthetic pleasure while programming and studying mathematics.

I love cooking, reading, listening to radio, and travelling.

I like instrumental and chillout music more, but hard rock goes well while working out.
I'm not an active swimmer but like to go for swimming at least once every month.

I make daily goals, and measure my progress at the end of the day.
I analyse the failure points and learn the good points. This feedback loop makes a better person; everyday.

I haven't read any novel from cover to cover. Lately, I have started reading this year (2017).

I like to share my useful thoughts and learnings through blogging. [Here are few things I learnt in my life]({{site.baseurl}}/about/things-learnt).
