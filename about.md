I'm Amit Thakur.

I'm a software engineer working for Infosys at Bengaluru, the silicon valley of India.

I spent my childhood at Jaipur, India. I completed my school and bachelor education in the same city.

I have a little family; my mother and sister, who is married. My father died when I was 7.

I never had stellar academic record, but I enjoyed studying mathematics and physics during high school. 
I loved making electronic projects. I got motivation for that from my elder cousin brother.

My mother bought me my first computer at the age of 20, during 1st year of my engineering college.
I wrote my first program in C++ on Windows 7 OS. I fell in love with it.
I tried a lot of things with computers, like, developing websites, desktop application applications 
for my college projects, and learning scientific computing using Matlab. 

I have affinity for matematics, physics, and computers. I see beauty in some patterns in objects, 
and feel aesthetic pleasure while programming and studying mathematics.

I love cooking and travelling.

I like instrumental and chillout music more, but hard rock goes well while working out at gym.
I'm not an expert swimmer but like to go for swimming at least once every month.

I make daily goals, and measure my progress at the end of the day.
I analyse the failure points and learn the good points. This feedback loop makes a better person; everyday.

I haven't read any novel from cover to cover. Lately, I have started reading this year (2016).

I like to share my useful thoughts and learnings through blogging.
