Hi! I'm Amit Kumar Thakur.

I'm a software engineer by profession and currently work at Vocera, Platform Team, at Bengaluru, India.

Previously, I was working for Thermo Fisher Scientific (3 years), and Infosys (2.5 years) in the same city.

I spent my childhood at Jaipur, India. I completed my school and bachelor education in the same city.

I never had stellar academic record, but I enjoyed studying mathematics and physics during high school. 
I loved making electronic projects. I got motivation for building circuits from my elder cousin brother, 
but real attachment started when I spent quite a time playing with my father's flash light torch and a 
portable radio, right from the age when I was a toddler.


My mother bought me my first computer at the age of 20, when I was in the 1st year of my engineering college.
I wrote my first program in C++ on Windows 7 OS. Since then, I tried a lot of things with computers, like, 
developing websites, desktop application applications for my college projects, and learning scientific computing 
using Matlab, OpenCV, and C++ language. 
[Here is the detailed list of tools and technologies I use]({{site.baseurl}}/about/tools-technologies-i-use) 
in my daily work.

I have affinity for mathematics, electronics, physics, and computer science. I see beauty in some patterns in objects, 
and feel aesthetic pleasure while programming and studying mathematics.

I love cooking, reading, listening to radio, and travelling.

I like instrumental and chillout music more, but hard rock goes well while working out.
I'm not an active swimmer but like to go for swimming at least once every month.

I make daily goals, and measure my progress at the end of the day.
I analyse the failure points and learn the good points. This feedback loop makes me more efficient; everyday.

I have cultivated habit of reading for last two years.

I like to share my useful thoughts and learnings through blogging.
