I'm Amit Thakur.

I'm a software engineer working for Infosys at Bengaluru, the silicon valley of India.

I spent my childhood at Jaipur, India. I completed my school and bachelor education in the same city.

I never had stellar academic record, but I enjoyed studying mathematics and physics during high school. 
I loved making electronic projects. I got motivation for that fro my elder cousin brother.

My mother (the only parent) bought me my first computer at the age of 20, during 1st year of my engineering college.
I wrote my first program in C++ on Windows 7 OS. I fell in love with it. 
I tried a lot of things with computers, like, developing websites, desktop application applications for my college projects, 
and learning scientific computing using Matlab.

I see beauty in some patterns in objects, and feel aesthetic pleasure while programming and studying mathematics.
